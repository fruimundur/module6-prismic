For this guide I created a little page where you can read short philosofical quotes.
On the Prismic GUI you can easily add a new quote post by simply adding a 'Post' slice to the homepage. Then in the slice you simply type in a headline, the quote itself and then add an image.

I created a button for each post which would open a new page with that post when clicked. However I was unable to render the button, as I was unable to get the routes to work. I spent hours
trying to solve it but in the end had to give up, and just hand in the guide so I could stay on schedule.

I also struggled a lot with the styling of the images. I was not able to make the image in the hero slice responsive. It also just lives on it's own on the page, and it pushes the rest of the content to the left when in mobile mode. Again, if I had more time I would have liked to find a way to fix this, but here we are.
